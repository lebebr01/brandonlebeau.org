In this study we examined the effects of prior mathematics achievement and
completion of a commercially developed, National Science Foundation-funded, or
University of Chicago School Mathematics Project high school mathematics
curriculum on achievement in students’ first college statistics course. Specifically, we
examined the relationship between students’ high school mathematics achievement
and high school mathematics curriculum on the difficulty level of students’ first
college statistics course, and on the grade earned in that course. In general, students
with greater prior mathematics achievement took more difficult statistics courses and
earned higher grades in those courses. The high school mathematics curriculum a
student completed was unrelated to statistics grades and course-taking.
