The relationship between high school mathematics curricula and the likelihood of students who enroll in a developmental (non-credit bearing) course in college taking additional mathematics courses was studied. The results showed that high school mathematics curriculum, years of high school mathematics completed, and A C T mathematics scores were related to developmental mathematics course-taking, but curriculum was not related to the subsequent mathematics course-taking o f students who began college with developmental mathematics.  The results have important implications for educational researchers and policymakers at the college and high school levels.
