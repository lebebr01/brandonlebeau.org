The first college mathematics course a student enrolls in is often affected by
performance on a college mathematics placement test. Yet validity evidence of
mathematics placement tests remains limited, even for nationally standardized
placement tests, and when it is available usually consists of examining a studentâ€™s
subsequent performance in mathematics courses. This study expands on existing
literature by considering whether a nationally standardized college mathematics
placement test (ACCUPLACER) contributes to the prediction of enrollment and
success in developmental and nondevelopmental mathematics courses above
and beyond prediction associated with the ACT mathematics test. Results for a
sample of more than 1,300 students from 20 postsecondary institutions suggest
that ACCUPLACER does not contribute to either the prediction of enrollment or
subsequent success in such courses, and that comparable information is provided by
using the ACT mathematics score alone. Implications of these findings are discussed.
