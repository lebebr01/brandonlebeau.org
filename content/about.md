I am currently an Assistant Professor of [Educational Measurement and Statistics](http://www.education.uiowa.edu/pq/measstat) at the [University of Iowa](http://www.uiowa.edu/). I was previously a Visiting Assistant Professor in the [Educational Statistics and Research Methods](http://edfd.uark.edu/) program at the [University of Arkansas](http://uark.edu) in Fayetteville, Arkansas. I also spent time at [Saint Paul Public Schools](http://www.spps.org) as an Assessment Specialist in the Research, Evaluation, and Assessment department.

I earned my Ph.D. from the [Quantitative Methods in Education](http://www.cehd.umn.edu/EdPsych/programs/QME/) program at the University of Minnesota in February 2013. While there I specialized in applied statistics and became interested in longitudinal modeling and computational methods. I also enjoy computing in general and have become proficient in numerous statistical programming languages, especially R.

Research
-------

 - **Linear Mixed Model Methodology:**  Model assumptions are needed for estimation, however real world data is messy.  My research attempts to explore situations when data violates certain assumptions and the implications this has on estimation and ultimately on the inferences we draw.

 - **Reproducible Research:** I enjoy developing tools and workflows that help researchers perform  reproducible research projects. Software tools include extending reports with dynamic conditional formatting of summary tables and search pdf documents for text strings/keywords. More details about these software can be found on my software page <https://brandonlebeau.org/packages/>. I also teach, discuss, and promote software that enhances reproducible research strategies.
 
 - **Computationally Intensive Procedures:** I have become drawn to methods that are computationally intensive, such as the bootstrap or advanced machine learning methods. I'm interested in extending these to situations where these methods are not commonly used, currently this is in education/measurement contexts.
