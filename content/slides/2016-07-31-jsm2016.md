# Background
- Began after Tim Brewster was fired at the University of Minnesota.
    + Now they have a new coach again!
- Wanted to try to predict next great coach.
- Proceeded to explore data available to answer this question.
</section>

<section>
# Data
- Data came from a few sources:
    + <http://www.cfbdatawarehouse.com/>
    + Wikipedia
</section>

<section>
# Goals
- Predict the 'ability' of the coaches.
- Find other variables that explain variation in the 'ability' of the coaches.
- Predict the next 'great' coach.

# Model

</section>

<section>
# Model 2
- Not a traditional IRT model as the game ID is not included.
    + The model does allow for a coaches ability to vary with years.
    + The team effect is constant.
- This model was fitted using R: `lme4` and `rstan`. 
- Results shown throughout are from `lme4`.
- 'Modern' era data, 1998 onward and coaches with at least 6 games per year.

# Does a coach overperform compared to average team ability?
- Value-added like logic.
- If coaches over/under perform compared to a team average
    + are they more likely to be retained?
    + if fired, are they a good fit for another team?
- How quickly does team expectation change?

# Next Steps
- Add covariates to model shown above
    + or use the ability estimates obtained above as an outcome.
- Explore moving average for team expectation.
- Explore good vs bad coaching hires.
